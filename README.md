Trello Image Downloader
========

This is a simple PHP script used on [Trello](https://trello.com/) that allows to download all images on your Trello board. It's great for offline usage, specially when you are going to some remote location and need all our assets with yourself. Just export the standard .json file available on your Trello board, include its file resource on the script and wait until the operation is finished.

Installation
--------
0. Provide the default values as requested on index.php.
1. Run index.php on any PHP v5!
2. Grab a beer and wait until the operation finishes (may take a while).

Support
--------
Just open an issue on Github and I'll get to it as soon as possible.
